# Wabbajack.Web

Forth revision of the official Wabbajack website. In this version we say goodbye to JavaScript/TypeScript and welcome our new favorite toy: [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/).

## Developing

Run the following command in the Wabbajack.Web folder:

```bash
$ dotnet watch run Wabbajack.Web.csproj
```

This will open your browser and dotnet-watch will automatically rebuild and reload when it detects changes.
